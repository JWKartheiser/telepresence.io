        <h2>Can you tell us about yourself and what your company does?</h2>

        <p>I am Piyush Mishra, Factotum at <a href="https://verloop.io">https://verloop.io</a>. Verloop is a conversational marketing platform. Which is a fancy way of saying that we are a SaaS platform to run livechat with chatbots as the first class citizen.</p>

        <h2>What was your pre-Telepresence development experience? What challenges did you face?</h2>

        <p>Before we switched to Telepresence, we used to use kube-openvpn to forward network from our staging to local and manage env variables separately with direnvor shell scripts. We didn’t need to forward the filesystem, so we never did that. Maintaining env variables was a pain, forwarding traffic from local to the pod was also a pain.</p>

        <h2>Why did you choose Telepresence?</h2>

        <p>We were going to roll our own internal software to do pretty much what telepresence does. Asked for similar solutions on kubernetes slack and looked up on Google. At this moment, I can’t remember where we found you guys, but I landed on your website and knew this was exactly what I wanted.</p>

        <h2>How did you roll out Telepresence to your development organization?</h2>

        <p>We were going to roll our own software so we kind of knew exactly what we wanted. First I tried it myself for a while. There were some features missing. Abhay had some issues in that direction, I jumped in and implement the POC-ish versions of each of those features and tried it out for a while longer. In that week I rolled our fork to the team. Since our fork was custom, I asked them to install from source of our branch.</p>

        <h2>What benefits have you seen since adopting Telepresence?</h2>

        <p>0 wait on build times has to be the biggest gain yet. We have builds from 30s to 4.5 minutes in length. With kube-openvpn, it was possible to avoid building to check every single time, but it was cumbersome to set up forwarding from our local to cluster. All of that went to 0 the day we switched to telepresence.</p>
